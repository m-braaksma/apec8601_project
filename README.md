# Earth Economy Modeling for APEC 8601: Natural Resource Economics

#### Country: Ghana
#### Scenarios: SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP8.5
#### Policy: 

### Executive Summary

## SEALS 

Use the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator (SEALS) to model land-use change and generate LULC maps for 2030, 2035, and 2040 under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios.

### Scenarios

- Scenario 1:
    - SSP1: Sustainability – Taking the Green Road (Low challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
    - RCP2.6: Least amount of climate forcing
- Scenario 2:  
    - SSP2: Middle of the Road (Medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
    - RCP4.6: Low amount of climate forcing
- Scenario 3: 
    - SSP5: Fossil-fueled Development – Taking the Highway (High challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation)
    - RCP8.5: Highest amount of climate forcing

### Scenarios under Policy

Suppose Ghana, in an effort to end deforestation, implements a policy that prevents any cropland expansion into forest land.

### Narrative Description


## InVEST

Based on the LULC maps generated by SEALS under the policy, use InVEST to forecast ecosystem service provision for carbon storage, annual water yield, pollination, sediment retention, and nutrient retention.
